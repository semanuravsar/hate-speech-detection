There are 3 main scripts performing training for the 3 experiments 
mentioned in the report and the video:

1. scripts/mtl-main-local.py
2. scripts/baseline-main-local.py

These two together does training for different mtl weights and also for baseline
it also calculates the test performance that produces the results for table 1 in 
our report

3. scripts/ablation-study-local.py

This code performs the ablation study and produces the results for table 2

(We have run the codes on cluster since the memory of our local computer 
was not enough to finish the training. Hence, the local versions are 
created just for the video and have not been tested untill the end, the only
difference is paths of the dataset, nevertheless case of any errors, the 
versions that can be run directly on the cluster are:

1. scripts/mtl-main-cluster.py
2. scripts/baseline-main-cluster.py
3. scripts/ablation-study-cluster.py)

Furthermore, we have the test scripts

1. results/test-toxigen.py

Calculates the performance of the trained models on toxigen
Produces the results for table 3

2. results/misclassification_fine_grain.py

Calculates the confusion of each type of implicit hate
Produces the results for table 4
